Developer Environment Setup
===========================

Requirements:
* Visual Studio 2015
* Xamarin Tools
* Windows 10
 
This solution relies on the Xamarin tools and SDK for iOS, Android, and other platforms. The Xamarin tools are now free, and you must add them to your Visual Studio installation before you can work with the projects in this solution.

Other dependencies are pulled from NuGet, and that should automatically occur on first build.
